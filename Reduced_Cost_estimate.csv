"Rationale:  I removed the read-replica instance, as this functionality can be achieved via the Multi-AZ deployment. This cut the database bill by half.",,,,,,,,
I also decreased the instance sizes of the application and web servers from c5ad.8xlarge to c5ad.4xlarge. This reduces our computing output,,,,,,,,
"by half, but it is within our budget.",,,,,,,,
